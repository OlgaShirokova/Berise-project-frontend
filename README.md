## Motivation

Being a girl is wonderful with one exception: the period. Everything related to the period is a hassle: calculating when it will come, remember to go to a store to but the needed products, finding the place that sells the preferred products, buying the right quantity and especially constantly having in mind this worry. To eliminate this hassle I created a web platform that will allow girls to pick their preferred products, select the date when they will need them and subscribe to a monthly service. After that Berise will deliver once per month all the preferred products to the clients door exactly when she needs them.
